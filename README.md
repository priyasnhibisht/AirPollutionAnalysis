# Air Quality Insights - R Shiny App


## Overview

**Air Quality Insights** is an interactive R Shiny web application that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on user-provided pollutant levels (PM2.5, CO, NO₂, and Ozone). The app leverages pre-trained machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to forecast AQI and provides health-related messages according to the predicted air quality category.
