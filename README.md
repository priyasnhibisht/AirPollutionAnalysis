# Air Quality Insights - R Shiny App


## Overview

**Air Quality Insights** is an interactive R Shiny web application that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on user-provided pollutant levels (PM2.5, CO, NO₂, and Ozone). The app leverages pre-trained machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to forecast AQI and provides health-related messages according to the predicted air quality category.

## Features

- 🌍 **Interactive Sliders** for pollutant input values
- 🤖 **Model Selection:** Choose between Linear Regression and Random Forest models
- 📈 **Instant AQI Prediction** with health impact messages
- 📊 **Summary Table** of your inputs and results
- ⚠️ **Error Handling** with clear user feedback

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- The following R packages:
  - `shiny`
  - `shinythemes`
  - `shinycssloaders`

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-quality-insights.git
    cd air-quality-insights
    ```

2. **Install Required Packages:**
    ```
    install.packages(c("shiny", "shinythemes", "shinycssloaders"))
    ```

3. **Add Model Files**
    - Place your pre-trained model files (`model1.rds`, `model2.rds`) in the project root directory.

4. **Run the App:**
    ```
    shiny::runApp()
    ```

## Usage

1. Adjust the pollutant values using the sliders.
2. Select your preferred prediction model.
3. Click the **Submit** button to view the predicted AQI, its category, and the associated health message.
